Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a project that was developed for the client driverpass. The goal of this design was to create a system to help people pass the drivers test as it was noticed by the owner there was an opportunity to help people pass at a higher rate. The system would offer three different packages which include online classes and practice test. The system would have different levels of users which would need different levels of access. security is always a major consideration with any software project. The system would also need to be able to allow customers to schedule driving lessons with different driversemployed by the company. The user also should have the ability to review their progress and feedback when using the system. 

What did you do particularly well?
The most enjoyable part of this class has been learning all of the different diagrams and what they represent. It was enjoyable to create the diagrams when we learn what the requirements of the system were. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe that it would be hard to pick just one part of the documents to work on as I feel that there can be improvements to all of them as nothing is ever perfect.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
We were given and interview guide with the questions and answer between the client, his team members, and our team. I printed the guide and highlighted areas I felt were necessary to design a system that would meet all of the clients needs. We are developing the system for the client they are the customer so every aspect of the design the need should be considered to ensure total satisfaction.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Throughout my time at SNHU my process of designing software has changed and this has been for the better. Having a solid plan and understand what steps need to be taken in what order is integral to creating well developed projects. I have learned it is best to take routes where you create you design with either diagrams such as we used in this class or pseudocode to help as a guide when coding the project.
